# Automation-Files
Once you specify your working directory, this code will access every folder in that working directroy. Each folder will have sub folders with text files in each and also an aggregate folder. This code will access each text file, rename it, move it to 'aggregate' folder and delete the folder the text file was moved from. In short, it will aggregate all files from multiple directories into one place!
